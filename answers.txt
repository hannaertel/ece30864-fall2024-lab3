a: One pro of Agile is that it is more resilient to changes in scope of the project and is able to still succeed in a timely manner with those. Another pro is that
it is a more iterative approach to developing code and creating a solution. One con is that you can't set as strict of deadlines due to this approach because
one part of the project make take longer than expected, and this approach allows for that. Another con is that it may be harder to follow what part of the process
each person is currently in because everything is happening concurrently. These are the pros and cons.

b: The Scrum Master is in charge of handling all of the planning associated with the Agile methodology such as hosting Stand Up meetings, organizing the Jira, 
and facilitating Sprints. The Product Owner is in charge of setting the direction of the team and managing the stakeholders in the product. 

c: Meeting 1: Sprint Planning Meeting: This moves items from the backlog to the current sprint and discusses what can be accomplished. It officially starts the sprint.
Meeting 2: Stand Up Meeting: 10 mins long, discusses current progress and problems. 
Meeting 3: Sprint Retrospective Meeting: Moves Items from sprint to backlog, discusses what was able to be accomplished and what couldn't be.

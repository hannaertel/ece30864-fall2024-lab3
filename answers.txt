a: One pro of Agile is that it is more resilient to changes in scope of the project and is able to still succeed in a timely manner with those. Another pro is that
it is a more iterative approach to developing code and creating a solution. One con is that you can't set as strict of deadlines due to this approach because
one part of the project make take longer than expected, and this approach allows for that. Another con is that it may be harder to follow what part of the process
each person is currently in because everything is happening concurrently.
